## Developer Installation

<!-- ### Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a virtual development environment manager backed by a provider like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

To start the Vagrant environment:

```
vagrant up
```

All dependency installation and configuration for the dev environment is in the `VagrantFile`. After installation, the node will automatically start and log all output to the console.

To log into the Vagrant environment:

```
vagrant ssh
```

To destroy and revert to the original state:

```
vagrant destroy
vagrant up
```

There will be a drive shared with the host machine inside the VM, mounted at `/vagrant`. -->

### Install

Install essentials:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl build-essential python git
```

Install PostgreSQL (min version: 9.5.2)

```
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb --password $USER
createdb persona_testnet
```

Install Node.js (tested with version 6.9.2, but any recent LTS release should do):

```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n 6.9.2
```

Install grunt-cli (globally):

```
sudo npm install grunt-cli -g
```

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/PersonaIam/personatestnet.git
cd personatestnet
```

Install node modules:
```
npm install libpq secp256k1
npm install
```

## Launch
To launch Persona on testnet:
```
createdb persona_testnet
npm run start:testnet
```

To launch Persona on localnet:
```
createdb persona_localnet
npm run start:localnet
```

To test stuff on local net use the genesis address:

```
passphrase: blade early broken display angry wine diary alley panda left spy woman
address: LMs6hQAcRYmQk4vGHgE2PndcXWZxc2Du3w
```

**NOTE:** The **port**, **address**, **genesis block** and **config-path** can be overridden by providing the relevant command switch:
```
node app.js -p [port] -a [address] -c [config-path] -g [genesisBlock-path]
```
This allow you to run several different networks, or your own private chain


## Launch your own private or public chain
Generate a genesisBlock.json + a default config.json containing all passphrases of genesis delegates
```
node tasks/createGenesisBlock.js
```

Be sure to configure this file for your needs

- a genesisBlock.json containing the genesis block
- a config.json containing configuration to start relay nodes
- an autoforging config.json containing configuration to start all delegates on a single node (for testing purpose)
- a bunch of config files to distribute to different configured delegate nodes starting the network.
- a delegatesPassphrases.json containing details about the genesis delegates
- a genesisPassphrase.json containing the details of delegates that will launch your network


Obviously you can hack away tasks/createGenesisBlock.js for your own custom use.

You can the start with your own chain on a single node (all delegates will forge on your single node) using:
```
createdb persona_newtest
npm run start:newtest
```

Then you can distribute the config.json (without the delegates secrets inside, and with custom peers settings) to peers to let them join your chain


```
npm run start:testnet
```

Run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

Run individual tests:

```
npm test -- test/api/accounts.js
npm test -- test/api/transactions.js
```

**NOTE:** The master passphrase for this test genesis block is as follows:

```
peace vanish bleak box tuna woman rally manage undo royal lucky since
```
